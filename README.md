# BingoGame

This project is for creating a Bingo Game. The game is written just for fun and for developing programming skills. The Bingo Game is written in C++ and uses LibCinder[1]. 
Since I'm relatively unexperienced with programming, the code seen in this project has a lot of potential for optimization. Feel free to comment on possible optimizations!
