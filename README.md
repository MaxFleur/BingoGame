# BingoGame

This project is for creating a Bingo Game. The game is written just for fun and for developing programming skills. The Bingo Game is written in C++ and uses LibCinder[1]. 
Since I'm relatively unexperienced with programming, the code seen in this project has a lot of potential for optimization. Feel free to comment on possible optimizations!

# Setup Instructions

1. Download and setup LibCinder. It is strongly recommended to do this via git. Further setup instructions can be found under [2].
2. After setting up LibCinder, clone this repository into the Cinder folder.
3. The BingoGame should now be in the directory ..\Cinder\BingoGame. Open the .sln under "vc2017" (MS Visual Studio is required) and compile the project.
