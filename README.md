# BingoGame

This project creates a basic BingoGame with 25 fields, a joker and some entrys. The entrys are randomized at the begin of the game and via clicking a restart "button".\
The game is written just for fun and for developing programming skills. It's written in C++ and uses LibCinder[1]. 
Since I'm relatively unexperienced with programming, the code seen in this project has a lot of potential for improvements. Feel free to comment on possible optimizations!

# Setup Instructions

Currently, this game only works with windows. The game was written using MS Visual Studio. The use Visual Studio is not necessarily required but strongly recommended.

1. Download and setup LibCinder. It is strongly recommended to do this via git. Further setup instructions can be found under [2].
2. After setting up LibCinder, clone this repository into the Cinder folder.
3. The BingoGame should now be in the directory ..\Cinder\BingoGame. Open the .sln under "vc2017" and compile the project.
